# Image_Retrival_EIE3280
This repository contains the code and [report](https://github.com/yoyostudy/Image_Retrival_EIE3280/blob/main/FinalProject/report.pdf)
 for the image retrieval project in course EIE3280@CUHKsz

In this project, we firstly crawled over 1000 images from Google Image using Scrapy. Secondly, we developed Text-based Image Retrieval method and Content-based Image Retrieval method to classify the dataset utilizing OpenSource package such as NLTK, OpenCV. Finally, for a new comming image, we will calculate the similarity between it the the representative of each classified dataset so as to give the top similar images.
